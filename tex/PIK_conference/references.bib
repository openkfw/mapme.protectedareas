A Dynamic Spatial Durbin Model taking into account both the location bias and the spatial spillover effects between municipalities allows to assess the impact of the different types of protected areas (integral protected areas, sustainable protected areas and indigenous lands) on deforestation. We show that deforestation decisions are strategic complements. The econometric results differ according to the type of protected area. It is shown that: i) integral protected areas and indigenous lands allow for reducing deforestation; ii) sustainable use areas do not help to reduce deforestation; and iii) the spillover effects generated by integral protected areas and indigenous lands lead a reduction in deforestation in their vicinity. A 10% increase in the surface area of integral protected areas (indigenous lands) allows an estimated 9.32 sq. km (10.08 sq. km) of avoided deforestation.}

  abstract ={Global efforts to reduce tropical deforestation rely heavily on the
establishment of protected areas. Measuring the effectiveness of
these areas is difficult because the amount of deforestation that
would have occurred in the absence of legal protection cannot be
directly observed. Conventional methods of evaluating the effectiveness
of protected areas can be biased because protection is not
randomly assigned and because protection can induce deforestation
spillovers (displacement) to neighboring forests. We demonstrate
that estimates of effectiveness can be substantially improved
by controlling for biases along dimensions that are
observable, measuring spatial spillovers, and testing the sensitivity
of estimates to potential hidden biases. We apply matching methods
to evaluate the impact on deforestation of Costa Rica’s renowned
protected-area system between 1960 and 1997. We find
that protection reduced deforestation: approximately 10% of the
protected forests would have been deforested had they not been
protected. Conventional approaches to evaluating conservation
impact, which fail to control for observable covariates correlated
with both protection and deforestation, substantially overestimate
avoided deforestation (by over 65%, based on our estimates).
We also find that deforestation spillovers from protected to unprotected
forests are negligible. Our conclusions are robust to
potential hidden bias, as well as to changes in modeling assumptions.
Our results show that, with appropriate empirical methods,
conservation scientists and policy makers can better understand
the relationships between human and natural systems and can use
this to guide their attempts to protect critical ecosystem services.},

Difference-in-differences estimations based on a panel of municipalities show that the policy change led to a substantial reduction in deforestation, mostly in municipalities where cattle ranching is the leading economic activity. The results suggest that the mechanism underlying these effects was a restriction in access to rural credit, one of the main support mechanisms for agricultural production in Brazil.}

  abstract={Whilst protected area (PA) networks remain a cornerstone of global conservation efforts,
persistent underfunding alongside the increasing severity of environmental degradation has
furthered interest in quantifying the ecological benefits they generate. However, the counterfactual
assessment of measures of effectiveness, such as avoided deforestation relative to unprotected
areas, are confounded by the non-random siting of PAs within landscapes, which
creates differential resource extraction pressures. Quasi-experimental techniques such as statistical
matching can account for differential pressures by selecting suitable control areas for
comparison by minimising variance across a suite of environmental and socio-economic covariates.
This study presents a national scale assessment of PA effectiveness for Cambodia, involving
46 PAs, employing nearest-neighbour propensity score matching using 8 covariates, with
repeated random sampling, to quantify avoided deforestation in 3 different outcome periods
between 2010 and 2018. The results demonstrate that, despite historic criticism, Cambodia’s PAs
generated significant positive avoided deforestation in all periods, with forested land in PAs being
as much as 12.5 % less likely to be deforested than matched unprotected forest. However, effect
size declined over subsequent time periods likely due to a combination of rising deforestation
pressure from agri-business concessions, followed by a large-scale expansion of the PA estate and
institutional rearrangements. The effectiveness of PAs in Cambodia varied with respect to PA age
and a significant positive spillover effect of PAs (maximum of 5.9 % reduction in deforestation
probability) was observed in 2 km buffer zones of increasing distance to PA boundaries. Our
findings are consistent with studies of other PA networks that report heterogeneous effects for
these phenomena.}

  abstract={Payments for ecosystem services are becoming popular components in strategies to conserve
ecosystems and biodiversity, but their effectiveness remains poorly documented. Here we present
counterfactual-based evidence on the conservation outcomes of the pilot stage of Peru’s National
Forest Conservation Program (NFCP). The NFCP provides direct payments to indigenous communities in the Amazon, conditional on avoided deforestation and the adoption of sustainable production systems. Using a spatially explicit quasi-experimental evaluation design, we show that the payment scheme has achieved only small conservation impacts, in terms of avoided deforestation. Counter-intuitively, these materialized largely on land not enrolled for conservation, due to spillover effects. Conservation effects on contracted land were negligible because communities were not chosen according to high deforestation threats, and they self-enrolled low-pressure forest areas for conservation. Occasional non-sanctioned contract incompliance contributed to these outcomes.We highlight implications for the design and implementation of up-scaled national conservation programs. Methodologically, we demonstrate the important role of choosing the appropriate spatial scale in evaluating area-based conservation measures.}

  abstract={Deforestation and conversion of native habitats continues to be the leading driver of biodiversity and ecosystem service loss. A number of conservation policies and programs are implemented—from protected areas to payments for ecosystem services (PES)—to deter these losses. Currently, empirical evidence on whether these approaches stop or slow land cover change is lacking, but there is increasing interest in conducting rigorous, counterfactual impact evaluations, especially for many new conservation approaches, such as PES and REDD, which emphasize additionality. In addition, several new, globally available and free high-resolution remote sensing datasets have increased the ease of carrying out an impact evaluation on land cover change outcomes. While the number of conservation evaluations utilizing ‘matching’ to construct a valid control group is increasing, the majority of these studies use simple differences in means or linear cross-sectional regression to estimate the impact of the conservation program using this matched sample, with relatively few utilizing fixed effects panel methods—an alternative estimation method that relies on temporal variation in the data. In this paper we compare the advantages and limitations of (1) matching to construct the control group combined with differences in means and cross-sectional regression, which control for observable forms of bias in program evaluation, to (2) fixed effects panel methods, which control for observable and time-invariant unobservable forms of bias, with and without matching to create the control group. We then use these four approaches to estimate forest cover outcomes for two conservation programs: a PES program in Northeastern Ecuador and strict protected areas in European Russia. In the Russia case we find statistically significant differences across estimators—due to the presence of unobservable bias—that lead to differences in conclusions about effectiveness. The Ecuador case illustrates that if time-invariant unobservables are not present, matching combined with differences in means or cross-sectional regression leads to similar estimates of program effectiveness as matching combined with fixed effects panel regression. These results highlight the importance of considering observable and unobservable forms of bias and the methodological assumptions across estimators when designing an impact evaluation of conservation programs.}

  abstract={The awareness of the need for robust impact evaluations in conservation is growing and statistical matching techniques are increasingly being used to assess the impacts of conservation interventions. Used appropriately matching approaches are powerful tools, but they also pose potential pitfalls. We outlined important considerations and best practice when using matching in conservation science. We identified 3 steps in a matching analysis. First, develop a clear theory of change to inform selection of treatment and controls and that accounts for real-world complexities and potential spillover effects. Second, select the appropriate covariates and matching approach. Third, assess the quality of the matching by carrying out a series of checks. The second and third steps can be repeated and should be finalized before outcomes are explored. Future conservation impact evaluations could be improved by increased planning of evaluations alongside the intervention, better integration of qualitative methods, considering spillover effects at larger spatial scales, and more publication of preanalysis plans. Implementing these improvements will require more serious engagement of conservation scientists, practitioners, and funders to mainstream robust impact evaluations into conservation. We hope this article will improve the quality of evaluations and help direct future research to continue to improve the approaches on offer.}
